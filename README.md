# DECbox
Blueprints and requirements for a box used to store DEC flipchips

## Examples

Overall dimensions for single, dual and quad cards:

Example Quad card (DR-11):

## Hard requirements

The box must:
1. fit DEC Hex wide cards lengthwise
2. fit DEC Quad wide cards along the breadth
3. cover the full height of the cards with handles
4. support the cards along the edge connecter
5. handle the weight of a full box of either quad or hex cards without deforming
6. avoid contact with the components of the cards
7. avoid interference between cards
8. avoid binding between the box and cards
9. have tight enough tolerance to avoid rattling

## Soft requirements

The box may:
1. accept sandwiched cards (such as the UNIBUS M9202 backplane connector)
2. have receptacle for "claw" to fasten boards that have them
3. lid that mates with board top edge without putting undue pressure on them
4. be stackable
5. have handles
6. allow dividers that creates room for dual and single width cards
7. be easy to assemble from a "flat" packaging
